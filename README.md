### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Working on my own thing these days.

#### Previously
- Worked on [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws-amplify).
- Member of the [Swift C++ Interoperability Workgroup](https://forums.swift.org/tag/cxx-interop).
- Member of the [MapLibre](https://github.com/maplibre) technical steering committee and contributor to [MapLibre GL Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native).

I'm self-taught without a CS degree, so if you have a similar story and want some advice on how to break into software engineering and/or continue to progress, hit me up.
