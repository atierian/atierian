### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love working on open source stuff, and somehow it's become my day job.
You'll find me here contributing to a number of different AWS projects, mostly related to [Amplify](https://github.com/aws-amplify), and mostly related to mobile. 

Outside of work, I'm a member of the [MapLibre](https://github.com/maplibre) technical steering committee and contribute as much as I can to [MapLibre GL Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native). I'm also a member of the [Swift C++ Interoperability Workgroup](https://forums.swift.org/tag/cxx-interop).

I'm self-taught without a CS degree, so if you have a similar story and want some advice on how to break into software engineering and/or continue to progress, hit me up. I'm not on social media, but you can find me in most iOS / Swift related Slack groups.
